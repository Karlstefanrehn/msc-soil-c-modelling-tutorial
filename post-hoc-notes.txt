Execution of tutorial
- Note entire tutorial delivered remotely thanks to Covid-19…
- Some students (n = 2) found that filter() was misfiring in the main plot function — didn’t find cause but cured by removing the geom_hline() element which required the filter() function as a precursor. Presume an issue with the relevant students’ OS, but unable to verify.
- Some students found that the IPCC coefficients didn’t match for certain crops, and this threw an error. THIS SHOULD BE SORTED IN TIME FOR NEXT YEAR!
- With remote delivery, many students didn’t watch the tutorial video/etc. until a couple of days before the deadline. Expect lots of last-minute cries for help if this is not dealt with ahead of time.

Lab reports
- Many students have foregone introductions, conclusions etc.
- Possibly because the handout gave them details of what to include that didn’t specifically say intro, conclusions etc.?

My notes
- Not sure how usable the box plot is — some students have tried — not very informative. Change?
- Possibly refine the alfalfa rotation scenario — made this up with limited time to spare!
- Clarify the lab report section to specifically request intro, discussion etc. so there’s no ambiguity.
